            <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
            <p class="faq">We train all of our customers to handle any situation in an interactive dance and skit, performed just seconds prior to the trip. We encourage all kids to come, we haven't had any come yet, so it should be interesting to see if they fit in adult sized life jackets, but they'll be fine. Some say some great things about us, "They have no clue what they are doing." - Brian Renolds, but we like to think we do. So bring your family and let's hope we hit any rapids for saftey concerns.</p>

            <h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
            <p class="faq">We are all certified in something here at Dry Oar! For example our lead river guide is certified in Karate (He's a black belt) lucky for us we'll be ok if a bear takes a swing at us. If you can swim, well, we'll tie you to the raft really tight, give you an oxygen take and scuba gear, that way you'll last a lot longer while we try to find you in the raft gets pulled under.</p>

            <h3>What is included in the trip?</h3>
            <p class="faq">The meals! We may include a raft for an extra fee but we aren't sure that's what we really want to focus on yet for this business. Our head cook is out of this world and brings us some strange things to eat all the time. We're not sure if he knows what he's doing or if he's making it up, it's just too over the top to tell. If we actually go rafting, you'll get to see it all from the lowest point and provide you with rocks that are perfect for skipping accross the river while you float.</p>

            <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p class="faq">Bring everything. Just in case.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Raft (Very important you bring this)</li>
                <li>Gold flakes (To put back into the river to make people think it's another gold rush)</li>
                <li>A bird calling guide book</li>
                <li>1 non-waterproof match (Safety is a big concern of ours - only you can prevent forest fires) </li>
                <li>Fishing line (We ran out last week)</li>
                <li>Life saving straw (We're curious if they really work)</li>
                <li>Hiking Books (In case you don't make it in time and have to walk along side to catch up with us)</li>

            <h3>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
            <p class="faq">Are you kidding?! It's the only way people should still travel! Cars pollute the earth. Plus bring a treasure map and we'll split the prize money with you 90/10 (We take the 90% cut).</p>

            <h3>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h3>
            <p class="faq">If you've read our contact page then you might know that we are incredibly hard to reach! We love the outdoors so much that we feel that you should already be here rafting. If we don't have enough room for you, we'll then grab your camera to take pictures of us while you hike along side! (Fees apply for hiking. All photos taken are property of Dry Oar No skipping allowed while hiking, that's why it's called a hike. arriving before or after the raft makes it to the finish point, hikers will be charged additional fees. The Hike is insanely difficult, and recommend the use of a pistol to fend off cougars and snakes however fees apply for every bullet shot, even if you miss. You may be arrested for killing wildlife.) </p>
